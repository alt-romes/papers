\section{Introduction}

\emph{Trees That Grow}\ref{} is a programming idiom to define extensible data
types, which particularly addresses the need for decorating abstract syntax
trees with different additional information accross compiler stages. With this
newfound extensibility, we are able to share one AST data type accross compiler
stages and other AST clients --- both of which need to define their own
extensions to the datatype. This extensibility comes from using type-level
functions in defining the data types, and having the user instance them with the
needed extension.

As an example, here is the extensible definition of an abstract syntax tree
(AST).

\begin{lstlisting}
type Var = String
data Typ = Int
         | Fun Typ Typ

data Expr p = Lit (XLit p) Integer
            | Var (XVar p) Var
            | Ann (XAnn p) (Expr p) Typ
            | Abs (XAbs p) Var (Expr p)
            | App (XApp p) (Expr p) (Expr p)
            | XExpr !(XXExpr p) -- Constructor extension point

type family XLit p
type family XVar p
type family XAnn p
type family XAbs p
type family XApp p
type family XXExpr p
\end{lstlisting}

And an AST with no additional decorations could be extended from the above
definition as

\begin{lstlisting}
data UD

type instance XLit   UD = ()
type instance XVar   UD = ()
type instance XAnn   UD = ()
type instance XAbs   UD = ()
type instance XApp   UD = ()
type instance XXExpr UD = Void
\end{lstlisting}

A drawback of this extensible definition of a datatype is that few can be done
without knowing the particular instance of the datatype's extension.
This means the defined AST is, by itself, unusable.

One of the promises of extensible data types is the reduction of duplicated
code, therefore, we might be tempted to define generic functions or type-class
instances for it. In the original paper some solutions are provided

\begin{itemize}
    \item ignore the extension points, although we no longer give the user the
        flexibility of an function or instance that takes into consideration the
        extension points they defined.

    \item or make use of higher order functions in the implementation, allowing for some
        custom usage of the extension points, but still restricted within the
        context of the generic implementation.
\end{itemize}

The second option, while more flexible, still isn't sufficient when faced with
the need to define a radically different implementation for a particular
constructor of the datatype, in which we might want to additionally make use of
the defined extensions. We might also note that to define functions generic over
the field extension points, a lot of higher order functions or dictionaries must
be passed to the functions, and the type-class instance of an extension point is
the same regardless of the constructor its found in.

We are then faced with the unattractive choice of either reducing duplicated
code at the cost of flexibility, or of requiring a complete implementation of the
function from any user needing that extra bit of flexibility.

This paper describes an idiom to define generic functions over the extensible
abstract syntax tree which allow drop-in definitions from the user that take
their extension instance into account.

\section{Watering Trees That Grow}

We would like to construct a clever way of having generic definitions of
functions over an extensible data type, definitions which allow the extensible
data type user to override particular parts of the implementation and delegate
to the generic implementation of the function the non-overriden cases ---
allowing for a possible complete reimplementation of the instance if desired.

At first sight, a function that can default to some other implementation can
simply be a function that takes as parameter a higher-order function which is
the default implementation itself.

With a small tweak, the default implementation itself always calls the
so called \emph{override} function and pass it the actual default implementation as
an argument.

For example, if we were to write a pretty printer for the above defined AST,
which by default works regardless of the extension points, but that can be
overriden on some or all constructors, we could have

\begin{lstlisting}
override :: (Expr p -> String) -> Expr p -> String

pprDefault :: Expr p -> String
pprDefault = override (\case 
    Lit _ i -> show i
    Var _ s -> s
    Ann _ e t -> "(" <> printE e <> ") :: (" <> printT t <> ")"
    Abs _ v e -> "λ" <> v <> "." <> printE e
    App _ f v -> "(" <> printE f <> ") (" <> printE v <> ")"
    XExpr _ -> "")
\end{lstlisting}

This naive approach doesn't quite solve it for us. First, it's just a sketch.
The function \emph{override} should be bound by \emph{pprDefault} ensuring each
client can pass a different override function. However, most importantly, we
must consider type-class instances whose function signatures we cannot change --
instances that we want to be defined near the datatypes so as not to create
orphan instances; and be able to write functions taking constraints rather than
higher-order functions, so that we have a common language for this pattern and
forget about which function is the right one to pass where.

Let's continue our example, saying we now want to create a generic instance for
the \emph{Show} type class instance. Show is defined as
\begin{lstlisting}
class Show a where
    show :: a -> String
\end{lstlisting}

We now want to instance \emph{Show} for our extensible AST right next to the
datatype (we don't want orphan instances!), but making sure the instance can
make use of the \emph{override} method, such that the user can override which
parts they desire of the default implementation.

So the following logical step is to create a class to abstract over the
\emph{override} pattern. Note, however, that this class musn't be
client-specific, as it should work for all clients the same. It should have the
following skeleton

\begin{lstlisting}
instance TheOverrideClass ??? => Show (Expr p) where
    show = override defaultShowExpr
\end{lstlisting}

The challenge here is what instances the class? \emph{Expr} is defined in the
client independent side, so we really wouldn't like to have anything to do with
it, since instancing it from the client side would mean an orphan instance. That
leaves us with \emph{p}, the pass parameter, which is defined by the client.

Calling the \emph{override} type-class \emph{TTG}, and for now saying the type
of override to be that needed by \emph{show}, we get

\begin{lstlisting}
class TTG p where
    override :: (Expr p -> String) -> Expr p -> String
\end{lstlisting}

Meaning we could now have, (saying we cautiously turn on UndecidableInstances)
\begin{lstlisting}
instance TTG p => Show (Expr p) where
    show = override defaultShowExpr
\end{lstlisting}

To address the next challenge of \emph{override} not yet working for any
function, we realize \emph{override} really is a function that takes some
function of type \emph{f} and returns a function of the same type \emph{f},
which can make use of the default one for the cases it doesn't want to override.

So we want to change the type signature of \emph{override} to be polymorphic
over \emph{f}. Unfortunately, we must extend the type-class with a parameter
specifying the type \emph{f} of the function we're overriding. By no longer
using the TTG parameter \emph{p} on the \emph{override} signature we need to
turn on \emph{AllowAmbiguousTypes}, which will require that \emph{override}
must always be called with an explicit type application specifying the \emph{p}.
This is fine, given that the override usage should be confined to the generic
functions over the extensible data type.

\begin{lstlisting}
class TTG p f where
    override :: f -> f

instance TTG p (Expr p -> String) => Show (Expr p) where
    show = override @p defaultShowExpr
\end{lstlisting}

Finally, we'll note that we might want to override, for the same pass \emph{p},
two functions of the same type. To disambiguate between this, and make our
instance more readable in the way, we'll use the \emph{DataKinds} extension to
annotate the \emph{TTG} override instance with the function it should override.

The following example showcases the use of the final \emph{TTG} override class
to define generic functions for both the pretty printer and show classes (which
have the same type).

Client-independent code
\begin{lstlisting}
class TTG p (s :: Symbol) f where
    override :: f -> f

instance TTG p "ppr" (Expr p -> String) => Pretty (Expr p) where
    ppr = override @p @"ppr" defaultPprExpr

instance TTG p "show" (Expr p -> String) => Show (Expr p) where
    show = override @p @"show" defaultShowExpr
\end{lstlisting}

Client-specific code
\begin{lstlisting}
data Decorated

type instance XLit   Decorated = String
type instance XVar   Decorated = ()
type instance XAnn   Decorated = Bool
type instance XAbs   Decorated = ()
type instance XApp   Decorated = ()
type instance XXExpr Decorated = Void

instance TTG p "ppr" (Expr p -> String) where
    override def = \case
        Lit s i -> "Ann:" <> s <> " -- " <> show i
        e@(Ann b e t) -> if b then def e else ""
        x -> def x

instance TTG p "show" (Expr p -> String) where
    override def = \case
        Lit s i -> "Ann:" <> s <> " -- " <> show i
        Ann b e t -> "Bool:" <> show b <> " -- " <> "(" <> printE e <> ") :: (" <> printT t <> ")"
        x -> def x
\end{lstlisting}

This approach still has its drawbacks. For one, this makes it impossible to
reuse parts of the default implementation, leading to code duplication in
branches similar to the default, and secondly, we depend on much type-level
machinery which complicates the program code, requiring both
\emph{UndecidableInstances} and \emph{AllowAmbigousTypes}, meaning the override
function requires explicit type applications.

There's still a somewhat big problem. How do we define a generic function such as
\emph{show} taking into consideration the constructors extension point? For
now, I think most reasonable way is to panic on the default implementation if there's
nothing like an \emph{monoid empty} on the return type -- and make sure the
override implementation handles the extra constructor case.
